# Sveltekit E-commerce app.
### As a self taught dev of 2 years, I wanted to showcase what I've learned so far by building beautful ecommerce store from the ground up.
 1. Sveltkit - My javascript UI framework of choice. I enjoy the SSG and Dev UX that Svelte provides. 
 2. Stripe - Stripe will be used as a payment processor for this app. 
 3. Supabase - This app will use Supabase for authentication and storage. Users will be able to sign up and I will store product details here as well. 
 4. SCSS - I will style the entire UI using scss. I enjoy building UI's from scratch ;)
 5. Typescript - I will be learning Typescript as I build this app. I'm already comfortable with JS.
